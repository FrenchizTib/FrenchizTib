### Hi there üëã I'm Thibault 

I am Thibault, a French junior data scientist living in Switzerland.
Student in mechanical engineering and then commercial, I decided to reorient myself towards the future: data science. I am more and more passionate about this field which brings so much personally and to businesses. The project possibilities are endless. I trained thanks to the organization ‚ÄúLe Wagon‚Äù which taught me a lot. To tell you a little more about myself, I am passionate about sports, particularly endurance sports such as running, cycling, etc. :running: :biking_man: :swimming_man:
